      <p>Welcome to Epic! If you haven't reviewed your training roadmap <em>(Mike to add a link)</em> with your mentor, plan to do that sometime in the next week since they'll be the biggest help in navigating the first few weeks of orientation and training. In short, the major things you should focus on during to start are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Completing tasks assigned to you during <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=1614">Orientation</a></li>
        <li>Working through your <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=33793">6 Month Assignments</a></li>
        <li>Attending our team's <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=32101">Canine Camp</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>And while your mentor can certainly help, remember that <em>you</em> own the success of your training! All of the above items should already be attached to you in Brainbow, but please be proactive and work with your TL and <a href="https://guru/Staff/EmployeeProfile.aspx?id=25524">Mike Gregory</a> in the event anything gets canceled, rescheduled, or if you think something's missing in the first place.</p>
      <p>Besides the physical classroom time already scheduled for you, you'll also be responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working through our team's Onboarding steps <em>(Mike to add a link)</em></li>
        <li>Scheduling and completing certification exams and projects</li>
        <li>Coordinating shadowing sessions with your mentor</li>
        <li>Prepring for a mock customer meeting</li>
        <li>Anything else that comes up!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="transfer">I'm a transfer</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the team! Start going through our team's Onboarding steps <em>(Mike to add a link)</em> as soon as you can, and plan on completing the following certifications and curricula within a month or so of your transfer date:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our team's <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=32101">Canine Camp</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=19035">Healthy Planet Internal Certification</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=17950">Caboodle Administration Internal Certification</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>I'm neither...</h2>
      <p>We're still happy to have you! It probably won't be worth your time to get certified in all the things, but you might consider dropping by some of the following courses in our team's <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=32101">Canine Camp</a> to get a feel for what we do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intro to Data Aggregation</li>
        <li>Intro to Connector Implementation</li>
        <li>Testing and Validation</li>
        <li>Connector Implementation: Keys to Success</li>
        <li>Connector Support: Customer Scenarios</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are all high-level classes that don't assume prior knowledge about claims or how to work in Caboodle, and would be good to take if you're planning to work with any Data Aggregation folks on a project.</p>
      <h1>6 Month Assignments</h1>
      <p>Even though you technically have 6 months to complete your <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=33793">6 Month Assignments</a> (what a concept), note that your camps will all be scheduled sometime in the first 2-3 months, and you should plan to finish your certification projects and exams shortly after. In addition to getting that sweet, sweet pay bump earlier, your initial training period is where you get to show off your work ethic (especially since your TL won't get to see you working on many other projects during this time).</p>
      <p>Also, keep in mind that the goal of training at Epic is not for you to memorize the content of every class, but rather for you to learn how to find information and develop good working habits so that you're better prepared to take on &quot;real&quot; work&mdash;if you breezed through college or a previous job and actually need to spend 5-6 months to acclimate, then that's also time well spent!</p>
      <h2>All-Epic Requirements</h2>
      <p>Everyone starting at Epic takes these&mdash;they won't be specific to your role, but hey, we expect everyone to have a baseline understanding of what it means to work in the healthcare industry...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Epic360
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction to what Epic software actually looks like for hospital and clinic staff. You'll attend the class as part of your orientation, but make sure to get around to the self-assessment afterward.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Patient Portal
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction to what Epic software looks like for patients. You'll need to take a (pretty easy) exam to get certified, and consider setting up your own MyChart account to help study!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Healthcare Essentials
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction to the healthcare industry as a whole, which is especially important if you don't come from a healthcare background. The exam (like most you'll take) is open-book, but there's a lot of material to study, so be diligent and actually set aside time to go through it!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Security and Privacy
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction to HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). We take the security of patients' protected health information (PHI) extremely seriously, and this class scratches the surface of what policies and procedures we maintain and follow as a result.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Escalations at Epic
          <ul>
            <li>Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated&mdash;as much effort as we put into developing and testing our software before installing it in customers' systems, there are still scenarios where patients' safety and privacy can be at risk. This class covers our company culture of escalation (and why that's a good thing).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Server Tech Camp</h2>
      <p>Server Tech Camp is a solid two-week period where you'll learn how to code in <code>M</code>,</p>
      <p>Note that both of the certification exams are <em>closed-book</em>, and the debugging and programming projects will</p>
      <h2>Healthy Planet</h2>
      <p>This is the major application camp you're placed into on the Data Aggregation team. We don't actually build and configure tools for the typical end users (clinicians, etc.), but we still need to be semi-knowledgeable about them since we work closely with the team that does (Healthy Planet). These camps are likely the most spread-out</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Healthy Planet Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Configuring the Epic End User</li>
        <li>Healthy Planet Clinical Build</li>
        <li>Healthy Planet Analytics Build</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Caboodle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>SQL Self-Studies</li>
        <li>Caboodle Administration</li>
        <li>Caboodle Development</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cogito</h2>
      <p>Most roles have separate <a href="https://wiki.epic.com/main/Internal_Reporting_Curricula#Overview">1-year reporting requirements</a> you have to complete before you're eligible for your first salary raise. Since we don't spend a lot of time working with the typical reporting tools like Reporting Workbench, Radar, or SlicerDicer (and since we <em>do</em> spend a lot of time working in Caboodle for now), we've opted to merge our team's reporting curriculum into the 6 Month Assignments.</p>
      <p>You may also notice that the Cogito Fundamentals camp doesn't get scheduled for you! That's because the Healthy Planet Analytics Build camp covers the same material and satisfies the &quot;other completion options&quot; listed in <a href="http://brainbow/Learning/Profile.aspx?id=32717&amp;path=Mjk4NDReMjk4NzN%2b">this grouper</a>. Unfortunately that's not the case for the projects and exams&mdash;you'll still need to complete those out-of-class Cogito requirements separately from the Healthy Planet ones, and you can find instructions on how to complete those here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://wiki.epic.com/main/Cogito_Training/Cogito_Fundamentals_Curriculum">Cogito Training wiki</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://galaxy.epic.com/?#Browse/page=8400!68!230!3918346,4065515">Cogito Fundamentals project instructions</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the Healthy Planet Analytics Build camp doesn't cover the Security chapter from Cogito training, so you'll want to get around to studying that too.</p>
      <h2>Handy Dandy Flowchart</h2>
      <p>If you don't have a good picture of what you're actually signed up for in Brainbow, we do have this flowchart that unfolds some of that pesky nesting of certifications, curricula, and groupers. You can click anywhere on the diagram to jump directly to that record in Brainbow, or you could <a href="https://wiki.epic.com/mediawiki/main/images/c/c9/EDI_Data_Aggregation_6_Month_Assignments.png">print it out</a> and cross off assignments as you complete them à la grade school planner! The nearest color printer (Hansel) is in the <a href="https://guru/Maps/?mapid=11614&amp;shapeid=53">copy room on the second floor of Grimm</a>, and CaTS has instructions on how to add a printer <em>(Mike to add link)</em>.</p>
